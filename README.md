# Conversational-Lathe-CAM
Coming very soon....

After searching the Internet for a simple to use Lathe Cam and not finding one, I decided to write my own.

This is the first version of this software.

I hope you can make use of this.

It's not meant to replace Fusion 360, FreeCad etc.

Also this is not for two sided machining or complicated drawing.

If you need the above features then you will need to $\color{green}{BUY}$ one of the above packages...

No drawing experience needed...

Just fill in your dimensions from a drawing...
